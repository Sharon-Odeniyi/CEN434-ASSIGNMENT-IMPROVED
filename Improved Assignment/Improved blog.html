        <section class="introduction">
            <p>Child marriage, defined as a formal or informal union where one or both parties are under the age of 18, is a grave violation of human rights. Despite international conventions and national laws, it remains a widespread practice, particularly affecting girls in developing countries. This practice robs children of their childhood, education, health, and future, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-heartbeat icon-danger"></i> Severe Health Risks</h3>
                <p>Child brides are often forced into early pregnancies, leading to higher rates of maternal and infant mortality due to underdeveloped bodies. They face increased risks of obstetric fistulas, sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), and chronic health problems. The psychological toll, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD, is also immense.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-book-open icon-danger"></i> End of Education</h3>
                <p>Marriage almost invariably marks the end of a girl's education. Denied the opportunity to learn and develop, child brides lose out on critical life skills, economic independence, and the ability to contribute fully to their communities. This limits their future prospects and perpetuates a cycle of poverty for their families.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-fist icon-danger"></i> Increased Violence & Abuse</h3>
                <p>Child brides are more vulnerable to domestic violence, sexual abuse, and exploitation. They often lack the maturity, support networks, and legal recourse to protect themselves. Their young age and subordinate position within the marital household make them easy targets for control and mistreatment, stripping them of their autonomy and dignity.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-coins icon-danger"></i> Perpetuating Poverty</h3>
                <p>Child marriage is both a cause and a consequence of poverty. Girls who marry young are less likely to be educated or employed, limiting their economic potential. Their children are also more likely to be malnourished and less educated, trapping families and communities in intergenerational cycles of poverty.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-brain icon-danger"></i> Profound Psychological Trauma</h3>
                <p>The loss of childhood, forced sexual relations, isolation, and lack of agency can lead to severe and lasting psychological trauma. Child brides often suffer from chronic stress, depression, anxiety, and a diminished sense of self-worth. These mental health challenges can affect them throughout their lives.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb icon-danger"></i> Lost Potential for Society</h3>
                <p>When girls are married off young, society loses out on their potential contributions as educated, healthy, and empowered citizens. They could be innovators, leaders, educators, and entrepreneurs. Preventing child marriage is not just about protecting individual girls, but about fostering stronger, more equitable, and prosperous societies.</p>
